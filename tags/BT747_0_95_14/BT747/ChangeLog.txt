Version 0.95.14
* PPC/WinCE: Create 'My Documents/BT747' directory if it does not exist to save the application settings.

Version 0.95.13
* Application will no longer switch off automatically on Palm devices - this avoids some (timeout)
  trouble on Palm devices and avoid autooff during download.
* Path to log directory can now be set from pull-down list.
* Validated operation on Linux system (PCLinuxOS) and adjusted 'run_rxtx.sh' script.

Version 0.95.12
* Google maps: when tracks are separated due to a trackpoint that is 'lost', track segments
  are interconnected with red line.


Version 0.95.11
* Added waypoints to Google Map output format and points are now 'encoded'.

Version 0.95.10
* Implemented 'GMAPS' output format : HTML file that will show trail on google maps.

Version 0.95.9
* Added functionality to read and change the NMEA string settings of the device.


Version 0.95.8
* PLT: conversion to height in feet was incorrect. Corrected.


Version 0.95.7
* NMEA format: speed written in knots was wrong conversion from speed in km/h
 (almost double instead of half).  Corrected.

Version 0.95.6
* Changed interface of connection tab.
* RxTx: different port name according to OS (Windows, Linux, Mac).  This allows direct
  use of RXTX on windows (and other systems) and should result in less installation
  hassle.
* Problems when interpreting satelite information solved:
 - data log specification problem;
 - last record of block;
 - false end of record identification.
* Moved BT747.jar and BT747_rxtx.jar to dist dir, this impact startup scripts.


Version 0.95.5
* Increased limits on fix setting (fix frequency slower than 1Hz now possible) and on 
  log reason settings (speed as low as 1km/h and distance as low as 1 m).

Version 0.95.4
* Added tickbox to remove difference between WGS84 and geoid (Mean Sea Level, MSL) from
  the logged height (as it was added by the logger).

Version 0.95.3
* KML format got improved: Track added (with extrusion) to show a line in stead of points.
* Some extra error messages in case of file problems.

Version 0.95.2
* Added specific target for Linux (serial port opening in entirely new class).
  A linux specific 'jar' file has been created (in the Linux directory).
  Experimental and untested.
* Bug fix: no more file was written when 'one file per day' was not selected.
* Performance improvement (profiled File output writing)
* KML format change (waypoints added).


Version 0.95.1
* Bug fix (on device): clone() method does not exist for arrays - replaced y explicit copy.
  User effect: java exception when converting to output format on device (solved).
* Bug fix: no more file was written when 'one file per day' was not selected.
* Performance improvement (profiled File output writing)

Version 0.95
* Bug fix (incorrect log interpretation when RCR and Distance not both logged)
* Satellite information now decoded from log.
* Satellite information written to CSV file.

Version 0.77.23
* Solved some bugs related to the file splitting per date & improved function to avoid files without elements.
* Added feature to change log format without erasing the device.  The resulting log can
  not be read by the original application delivered with the device, but this program
  can read the log.
* Worked around a problem when satellite specific data is logged (sid, ele, snr, azimuth).
  The amount of data varies with the number of satelites - this is now covered for.
  The data is not interpreted though and not written to any output file (sorry, but I do
  not need that function and this is volunteering!).

Version 0.77.22
* All formats now have a filename including the date.
* Method reuse in file output classes (resulting in smaller footprint)

Version 0.77.21
* Added popup message when file for download could not be opened.
* GPX: filename now includes date.  If 'one file per day' is checked, then there are as many
  files as there are days logged.
* Resolved bug concerning retrieving settings when upgrading.
* The trkpts in the gpx file now also include the comments.

Version 0.77.20
* Added new tab with some functions frequently requested on forums (fix freq.) and some not
  available on other tabs (hot/warm/cold start).

Version 0.77.19
* On ppc (wince), settings now saved on program exit.
* Log point filtering now separated for waypts and trkpts.
* Optimizing with proguard (resulting in smaller object files)

Version 0.77.18
* Updates to gpx format
* Setting saved on ppc (wince) OS.  Must click on 'set values button' in 'File' tab for the moment to save the settings.

Version 0.77.17
* Modified display of device version and application SW version for better information.
* Added NMEA output format (readable by locr SW).
* Added script and instructions for launching on Linux - partially validated.

Version 0.77.16

* Solved problem regarding timeout on first request.  Fixes double requests for same data and speed up download.
* CSV: LAT/LON values no longer converted to positive values.  In that manner paths can be shown
  directly in an excel graph.

Version 0.77.15

* Not really tested dev version!!!  Purpose deliver latest version on the web before 3 weeks leave.
* Should solve filtering bug when RCR or VALID field missing.
* Some (unnoticeable) bugs resolved.

Version 0.77.14

* Correction of calculation for percentage of memory used.
* Getting device firmware version & model.
* Improved log download on portable device (Palm).
   -> Command acknowledge taken into consideration
   -> Timeout implementation on 'check log'
* PLT format revisited (from http://www.oziphototool.com/fileformats.html)
* CSV format: units no longer mentioned in fields, only in header.

Version 0.77.13

* Added UTC offset field.  This will change the output time and midnight time for date selection.

Version 0.77.12

* Handling more field.  Now all are handled except the variable fields concerning satelite
  information.
* Some (supposed) improvement on data download from device.  This is difficult to validate.

Version 0.77.11

* Added read of flash options (did not activate writing them since not possible it seems)

Version 0.77.10

* Added configuration option 'overwrite/stop'
* Added card selection functionality for Palm devices.
* Allow floating point entry for time interval.  Usefull for 5Hz logging (set time
  interval to 0.2s and fix to 200 ms).

Version 0.77.9

* Added connection version to connection page
* Correct logic concerning null pointer (hopefully this works!).
* Added repaint for all items that were potentially updated after reception of data.
* Added initial version to write Ozi PLT file.

Version 0.77.8

* Problem with default directory setting solved (null pointer)
* Download chunk size and timeout are configurable (for finetuning)


Version 0.77.7

* Following feedback from users, setting download chunck size to 0x200 by default.
* On PPC and WinCE devices, improved the default setting of the output directory.

Version 0.77.6

* Solved 'bug' concerning Gps status update propagation by introducing specific events.

Version 0.77.5

* Implemented more finegrained incremental download.

Version 0.77.4

* Fixed problem when saved option string was empty (resulted in reset).

Version 0.77.3 
* Fixed problem when launching first time (no saved options)

Version 0.77.2
* File setting configuration and memorization.
* Palm download chunck size adjustment

Version 0.77.1

  Now downloading smaller packets & matching size downloaded.
* It is possible to set the base directory for file operations.
* Added more ports to connect to.

Version 0.76

* Fixed incremental logging partially, but still problems to make it work on Palm
   (works on PC) - something to do with read/write capabilities of files on PalmOS.
* The log can now be converted correctly without being connected - the log format
  information is retrieved from the log file itself.
* Added a '.bat' script to launch on windows.

Version 0.75

* Incremental download of log added
* Date filter : corrected calculation of internal UTC date.

Version 0.7

* Added log filtering capability.

Version 0.6

* Added conversion to 'gpx' format;
* Solved issue retrieving log format when clicking on tab;
* Kml format slightly improved so that Google Earth recognizes the time.

Version 0.51

* Added conversion to KML
