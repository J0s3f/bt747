Version 1.34
* Back to using the log format bit #31 to identify the log as a Holux specific log.
  The 'HOLUXGR241LOGGER' string is not necessarily in the log!

Version 1.33
* If binary file has '.trl' extension, it will be interpreted as a Holux tracklog file.
  Careful: the application can not generate such a file!

Version 1.32
* Added estimation of number of records to log Format Tab.

Version 1.31
* Ignoring NMEA data done at an earlier stage while downloading - hopefully improves
  performance on PDA devices.
* Focus highlighting made configureable and disabled by default on some devices.

Version 1.30
* CompeGPS 'TRK' format added
* Extra NMEA strings added to NMEA format (GSA,GSV)

Version 1.29
* Using other technique to determine if log is from a holux (M-241) device.
* Buttons turning green during conversion.

Version 1.28
* Support for Holux M-241 added - the log is slightly different from the other devices
  but is now correctly handled for time, lat, lon and height data.

Version 1.27
* Selected port number was not correctly recovered from settings.

Version 1.26
* Possibility to change baud rate setting.
* Removed 'USB' button, no longer usefull (other means exists)

Version 1.25
* Updated the UTC range to go up to +14.

Version 1.24.1
* Added new button on the 'Easy tab': Forced erase.  This will reformat the log and reset
  any statistics regarding bad sectors.
* Added initial delay to check if erase was successfull.

Version 1.23
* NSAT advanced filter logic was inverted - corrected

Version 1.22
* Solution provided in 1.21.2 resulted in KML format generation problems.
  Solution is improved.

Version 1.21.2
* Extra 'DataFooter' was written at end of file (at least for the GPX format) - solved.

Version 1.21.1
* Added flash device type (no functional changes)

Version 1.21
* Advanced filter was not set up correctly - correctly.
* Index out of range could occur when estimating size of a record due to signed
  bit shift - solved (unsigned bit shift).

Version 1.20
* Solved several problems related to multiple and single file creation.

Version 1.19.1
* Added an extra condition for MacOS to solve the flicker with menus and popups.
  The program seems to behave normally on that OS now.

Version 1.19
* Added a popup when erasing that disappears when the erase is finished.
* Lag delay resolution on MacOS resolved - popups will flicker on MacOS though.
  This looks very much like a SuperWaba problem - maybe it will get analysed so
  that flicker on MacOS can be made to disappear.  At least the lag is gone.

Version 1.18
* Yet another update to try and solve the MacOS lag problem.
* More information shown on the connection tab (Flash Information & logger version)
* Added possibility to log a point with a specific reason other than speed, distance, time, button, ..
* Added possibility to change value for color of invalid tracks (currently in GMAP format)
* Solved bug releated to trackpoints not being written to the first file in certain output formats.


Version 1.17.X  - BETA
* Yet another update to try and solve the MacOS lag problem.

Version 1.17
* Yet another update to try and solve the MacOS lag problem.

Version 1.16
* Added a timer to the applciation to see if this solves the MacOS GUI lag issue.

Version 1.15
* Reading GPS in 10ms intervals only - hopefully resolves 'speed' issue on MacOS.

Version 1.14
* Changed 'magvar' in 'course' for the 'heading' value in the 'gpx' format.

Version 1.13
* MacOSX startup script corrected (line endings, line split)
* Added possiblity to disable GPS NMEA String decoding (on Con tab).  Could have some
  impact on performance.
* Added possibility to write values to Flash (other tab) as some devices have a
  timesleft value other than 0.

Version 1.12
* Correction in advanced filter for NSAT filtering.
* Changes that should be 'invisible' to the user: calls to the superwaba environment pushed
  into a separate package for the 'core' of the program.  This prepares for J2ME implementation.
* Added functionality to be able to define the configuration file on the command line
  in 'RXTX' mode.

Version 1.11
* Added extra option to no longer separate in different tracks in GPX mode when new menu option is set.

Version 1.10
* Advanced filtering added (filtering on PDOP, VDOP, HDOP, speed, distance, record number.
  A new subtab in the filter tab added.  Advanced filtering must be set to 'active' in that
  tab to enable the filtering.

Version 1.09
* Correction to speed in GPX format (was always 0 after the change for 1.08.
* Incremental download: small improvement.

Version 1.08
* Fixed problem in incremental download (usefull data detection had an error => too much data redownloaded).
* GPX format: speed was in km/h and has to be in m/s -> solved.
* Incremental download: if data is different than before, user confirmation is requested.
  This way the user can still change the raw data filename (avoid overwriting previous data by mistake).
* NMEA format: more precision added (2 extra digits for position and one extra digit for speed).

Version 1.07
* Added path browsing capability to 'LogFile' entry on Filetab.  This allows easy opening of
  previously saved raw data file.
* Added functionality to separate files based on track time separation.

Version 1.06
* GPRMC NMEA string made similar to the one coming from device (extra field indicating autonomous or DGPS).
* Showing current Lat, Lon and Height in Connection window (if values are shown, reception is ok).

Version 1.05
* Added possiblity to force UTC offset in GPX format to 0 regardless of UTC setting.

Version 1.04
* Filter condition changed: now no longer selecting points when all conditions 'deselected'.
* Debug activation added in menu (and stats activation added, but not useable yet).

Version 1.03
* When no height was logged, problem in KML format (empty height) string resulting in bad
  display -> solved.
* Reason for 1.02: Proguard version problem -> false alert.  Actually a user problem.

Version 1.02
* Moved back to previous ProGuard version.  One user had a different behaviour on his handheld device.

Version 1.01
* Moved to ProGuard 4.0.1 (jar file optimization)
* Some optimizations in settings code.
* If not selecting ZDA, time for NMEA strings was incorrect.

Version 1.00
* Version 0.96.3 has been out for long enough.  I consider the application as stable enough to call it 1.00. 
* Added some extra error messages being propagated to the end user (file open/creation).
* It is now possible to select the NMEA strings to be written to the output file  (Other tab -> NMEA File tab).
* The device type (Model) is identified by its commercial name (or commercial equivalent).

Version 0.96.3
* A change for Macintosh: The mac does not need a port number, so port number omitted.
  Added possibility to override port name completely.

Version 0.96.2
* A bug in the incremental download was introduced in 0.96.1.  The end of valid data was incorrectly identified.
  Corrected in this update.
  
Version 0.96.1
* Revisited log download algorithm.  Now requests can be queued.
  This was efficient over bluetooth where download was about 54k/second with the following settings on Palm:
    - Chunk size=220
    - Log ahead request=3
    - Timeout=3500
    - Fix = 500 ms
    - NMEA Output:
       RMC=1
       GGA=GSA=GSV=2

Version 0.95.14
* PPC/WinCE: Create 'My Documents/BT747' directory if it does not exist to save the application settings.

Version 0.95.13
* Application will no longer switch off automatically on Palm devices - this avoids some (timeout)
  trouble on Palm devices and avoid autooff during download.
* Path to log directory can now be set from pull-down list.
* Validated operation on Linux system (PCLinuxOS) and adjusted 'run_rxtx.sh' script.

Version 0.95.12
* Google maps: when tracks are separated due to a trackpoint that is 'lost', track segments
  are interconnected with red line.


Version 0.95.11
* Added waypoints to Google Map output format and points are now 'encoded'.

Version 0.95.10
* Implemented 'GMAPS' output format : HTML file that will show trail on google maps.

Version 0.95.9
* Added functionality to read and change the NMEA string settings of the device.


Version 0.95.8
* PLT: conversion to height in feet was incorrect. Corrected.


Version 0.95.7
* NMEA format: speed written in knots was wrong conversion from speed in km/h
 (almost double instead of half).  Corrected.

Version 0.95.6
* Changed interface of connection tab.
* RxTx: different port name according to OS (Windows, Linux, Mac).  This allows direct
  use of RXTX on windows (and other systems) and should result in less installation
  hassle.
* Problems when interpreting satelite information solved:
 - data log specification problem;
 - last record of block;
 - false end of record identification.
* Moved BT747.jar and BT747_rxtx.jar to dist dir, this impact startup scripts.


Version 0.95.5
* Increased limits on fix setting (fix frequency slower than 1Hz now possible) and on 
  log reason settings (speed as low as 1km/h and distance as low as 1 m).

Version 0.95.4
* Added tickbox to remove difference between WGS84 and geoid (Mean Sea Level, MSL) from
  the logged height (as it was added by the logger).

Version 0.95.3
* KML format got improved: Track added (with extrusion) to show a line in stead of points.
* Some extra error messages in case of file problems.

Version 0.95.2
* Added specific target for Linux (serial port opening in entirely new class).
  A linux specific 'jar' file has been created (in the Linux directory).
  Experimental and untested.
* Bug fix: no more file was written when 'one file per day' was not selected.
* Performance improvement (profiled File output writing)
* KML format change (waypoints added).


Version 0.95.1
* Bug fix (on device): clone() method does not exist for arrays - replaced y explicit copy.
  User effect: java exception when converting to output format on device (solved).
* Bug fix: no more file was written when 'one file per day' was not selected.
* Performance improvement (profiled File output writing)

Version 0.95
* Bug fix (incorrect log interpretation when RCR and Distance not both logged)
* Satellite information now decoded from log.
* Satellite information written to CSV file.

Version 0.77.23
* Solved some bugs related to the file splitting per date & improved function to avoid files without elements.
* Added feature to change log format without erasing the device.  The resulting log can
  not be read by the original application delivered with the device, but this program
  can read the log.
* Worked around a problem when satellite specific data is logged (sid, ele, snr, azimuth).
  The amount of data varies with the number of satelites - this is now covered for.
  The data is not interpreted though and not written to any output file (sorry, but I do
  not need that function and this is volunteering!).

Version 0.77.22
* All formats now have a filename including the date.
* Method reuse in file output classes (resulting in smaller footprint)

Version 0.77.21
* Added popup message when file for download could not be opened.
* GPX: filename now includes date.  If 'one file per day' is checked, then there are as many
  files as there are days logged.
* Resolved bug concerning retrieving settings when upgrading.
* The trkpts in the gpx file now also include the comments.

Version 0.77.20
* Added new tab with some functions frequently requested on forums (fix freq.) and some not
  available on other tabs (hot/warm/cold start).

Version 0.77.19
* On ppc (wince), settings now saved on program exit.
* Log point filtering now separated for waypts and trkpts.
* Optimizing with proguard (resulting in smaller object files)

Version 0.77.18
* Updates to gpx format
* Setting saved on ppc (wince) OS.  Must click on 'set values button' in 'File' tab for the moment to save the settings.

Version 0.77.17
* Modified display of device version and application SW version for better information.
* Added NMEA output format (readable by locr SW).
* Added script and instructions for launching on Linux - partially validated.

Version 0.77.16

* Solved problem regarding timeout on first request.  Fixes double requests for same data and speed up download.
* CSV: LAT/LON values no longer converted to positive values.  In that manner paths can be shown
  directly in an excel graph.

Version 0.77.15

* Not really tested dev version!!!  Purpose deliver latest version on the web before 3 weeks leave.
* Should solve filtering bug when RCR or VALID field missing.
* Some (unnoticeable) bugs resolved.

Version 0.77.14

* Correction of calculation for percentage of memory used.
* Getting device firmware version & model.
* Improved log download on portable device (Palm).
   -> Command acknowledge taken into consideration
   -> Timeout implementation on 'check log'
* PLT format revisited (from http://www.oziphototool.com/fileformats.html)
* CSV format: units no longer mentioned in fields, only in header.

Version 0.77.13

* Added UTC offset field.  This will change the output time and midnight time for date selection.

Version 0.77.12

* Handling more field.  Now all are handled except the variable fields concerning satelite
  information.
* Some (supposed) improvement on data download from device.  This is difficult to validate.

Version 0.77.11

* Added read of flash options (did not activate writing them since not possible it seems)

Version 0.77.10

* Added configuration option 'overwrite/stop'
* Added card selection functionality for Palm devices.
* Allow floating point entry for time interval.  Usefull for 5Hz logging (set time
  interval to 0.2s and fix to 200 ms).

Version 0.77.9

* Added connection version to connection page
* Correct logic concerning null pointer (hopefully this works!).
* Added repaint for all items that were potentially updated after reception of data.
* Added initial version to write Ozi PLT file.

Version 0.77.8

* Problem with default directory setting solved (null pointer)
* Download chunk size and timeout are configurable (for finetuning)


Version 0.77.7

* Following feedback from users, setting download chunck size to 0x200 by default.
* On PPC and WinCE devices, improved the default setting of the output directory.

Version 0.77.6

* Solved 'bug' concerning Gps status update propagation by introducing specific events.

Version 0.77.5

* Implemented more finegrained incremental download.

Version 0.77.4

* Fixed problem when saved option string was empty (resulted in reset).

Version 0.77.3 
* Fixed problem when launching first time (no saved options)

Version 0.77.2
* File setting configuration and memorization.
* Palm download chunck size adjustment

Version 0.77.1

* The PalmOS BT buffer seems 'small' and overruns happened going unnoticed by the SW.
  Now downloading smaller packets & matching size downloaded.
* It is possible to set the base directory for file operations.
* Added more ports to connect to.

Version 0.76

* Fixed incremental logging partially, but still problems to make it work on Palm
   (works on PC) - something to do with read/write capabilities of files on PalmOS.
* The log can now be converted correctly without being connected - the log format
  information is retrieved from the log file itself.
* Added a '.bat' script to launch on windows.

Version 0.75

* Incremental download of log added
* Date filter : corrected calculation of internal UTC date.

Version 0.7

* Added log filtering capability.

Version 0.6

* Added conversion to 'gpx' format;
* Solved issue retrieving log format when clicking on tab;
* Kml format slightly improved so that Google Earth recognizes the time.

Version 0.51

* Added conversion to KML
