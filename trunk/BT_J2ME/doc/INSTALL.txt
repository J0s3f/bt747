Introduction
============

Any phone not being to strict on 'security' (read: operator revenue protection)
with a CLDC 1.1 / MIDP 2.0 profile and JSR82 support (bluetooth library) should
be able to run the J2ME version of BT747 (if the specification says MIDP2.0,
it is probably OK. For a list of known phones, see further below
(leave a message in the forum if your phone is not on the list).

The best overview that you can get right now of the J2ME version is on Dirk Haase's
site: http://www.haased.de/gps_ge/bt747_anleitung_mp.html .

The J2ME version of BT747 is still in beta and corresponds to different binaries
than the SuperWaba or J2SE versions! Look in the discussion pages to find out more
about it.

===========================
BT_J2ME.cod - This file is for blackberry only (if available).

INSTALLING the J2ME Version
===========================

Method 1)

Copy the '.jar' file to your phone. Open it in the file explorer - the phone should
prompt you to install.
Sometimes you need to delete the previous version first.
On some phones the '.jar' is not enough and you need the '.jad' too.

Method 2)
Provide the internet URL of the '.jar' (or '.jad') when following the phone's procedure
to install a java procedure

Method 3)
Right click on the '.jar' on your PC and do 'Open with' -> 'Nokia application installer'.

Currently the application comes unsigned. For (some) Sony Ericsson phones you can
self-sign the application. Look form 'Halmer' or 'EQHalmer' in your favorate search
tool. When making an official distribution, a signed version of the app will be
added for phones that support self-signing. For other phones, an expensive
certificat must be bought. If we (author) would get $1 for every download, then
that would be feasible in a week (@180 downloads/day) for one certificate.
Compared to $45 as is charged for a Mac only solution, this is not a lot.
Without signing, your phone will regurarly ask to confirm authorisation to access
the filesystem, bluetooth, etc. . It is obvious that for this application to run
that you need to reply 'yes' every time.

You can hack your phone to disable these limitations. We do not recommend this but
provide the information to avoid you having to ask the question. Here are some links
to topics that explain how to do so at your own risk.
http://www.symbaali.info/2007/10/hacking-s60-3rd-edition-firmware.html as a first method
and http://symbianhack.site666.info/ to install ROMPatcher followed by
http://www.mobilesmania.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=53542&mode=threaded as a second
method.


How was it built?
Basically, the same core code as the original BT747 application is used. Of course,
the 'system layer' had to be changed and the GUI layer too. For the GUI, modified
"J4ME" library is used to build the J2ME version of the application - see www.j4me.org.
