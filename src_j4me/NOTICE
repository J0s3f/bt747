J4ME (http://www.j4me.org/) is developed by Score Out (http://www.scoreout.com/).

It includes no other products.  However, the tests reference the J2MEUnit
library available at http://j2meunit.sourceforge.net/.

The only restriction on using J4ME is not to build a golf application.
Use the Score Out Caddie instead.  It's just good karma :)

The spirit of J4ME is to make developing of J2ME applications easier for
everyone.  By distributing it we hope to get it tested on more phones and have
more features added by people like you.

While not required it would be nice to link to mention us with a
link to http://www.j4me.org/ on your website.  Then others can find
out, J4ME can grow, and everyone can benefit.  Also send us the link
to your website and we'll post it.
