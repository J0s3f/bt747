A small text files with things that can be done for BT747.
There is no particular plan to implement this.  It is mainly a list so that nothing is forgotten.

PROBLEMS
* When there are a lot of pictures, loading the previews is too slow.
  - Need to improve worker task.
  - Could use preview data already available in pictures.
  
* Check the autolog functionality and integrate it in BT747.

COSMETIC IMPROVEMENTS
* Remove all GUI data when the input file is changed.
  Potentially make this configureable.
* Use part of file name in KML output (and others) in stead of GPS-extratext.
* Use BT address in output file.    

IMPROVEMENTS
(Things not very visible to the user).
* Report error of GPX upload.
* Detect power up/rest of device (Initial PMTK010) and use it to request all the values again.
* Need to indicate that the device needs formatting in all setups (J2ME, PDA).
* Improve image thumbnail generation and caching.
* Improve waypoint handling (when there are many): put drawing them in a separate thread.

FEATURES

Application
* Implement a sanity check of the parameters and warn the user if they seem strange:
  - Log conditions will not really log anything;
  - LAT/LON/TIME missing from format;
  - Too many NMEA strings for the serial speed.
* Automatically download data and upload to a server.
* Act as a server.
  - Show current position;
  - Allow remote app to get past data;
  - Provide map (html output, but through the server);
  - Allow configuration using browers (could also work on the local machine).
* Build a database of tracks:
  - Find past tracks easily based on time or on location;
  - Tag files without explicitly providing the files to use;
* More advanced track filtering.
* [Partially] rethink GUI.
  - Geotagging interface must be better;
  - Provide interface for dummies:
     Download
     Tag
     Convert
     Easy configurations
        (On foot,
         By car,
         Personal constraints
           [est. travel distance, travel time, precision
            and determine log conditions from that]
* Incremental download of 'overwrite' data by appending to existing file.
* Send SMS with past positions.

Device
* AGPS capability.
   Add button to select local file for AGPS data.
   Add functionality to choose selected data range
* Add SIRFIII support.
* Detect that a device has bad blocks.  Skip the blocks/propose to repair.
  [Does not seem to happen that often]
* Add support for 
  http://code.google.com/p/skytraq-datalogger/source/browse/#svn/branches/0.3

Tracks
* Allow changing data in J2SE gui.
* Allow saving data from the J2SE gui table(s).
* Allow color configuration.

Tagging
* Allow tagging using the exiftool.
* Allow tagging of other files by renaming them.
  As a coordinate format:
   decimal coordinates an hemispheres separated by underlines.
* Reverse geocoding.

Map
* Add scale to map.
* Use specific icons according to the waypoint type.
* Add google map - the legal way (integrate a browser).
* Add statistics for the path:
   - traveled distance since start
   - traveled distance to end
