# ODB Defaults 20.Nov.04 -- You may edit by hand. See Manual for details

#                        Class & method names must be complete. '*' must be freestanding.
# DidntInstrument:       This is informative only. (You may change to InstrumentOnly.)
# DontInstrumentMethod:  These methods won't be instrumented (but may be recorded).
# DontRecordMethod:      These methods won't be recorded (ie, from the calling method).
# DontEither:            These methods won't be recorded or instrumented.
# MaxTimeStamps:         This is overridded by the command line argument, hence seldom used.
# StartPattern:          Recording will start when this pattern is matched.
# StopPattern:           Recording will stop when this pattern is matched (no restarts!).
# SourceDirectory:       If sources can't be found normally, look here.
# OnlyInstrument:        Only classes which match this prefix will be instrumented.
# OnlyInstrument:        "" means default package only. No entry means everything.
# UserSelectedField:     This instance variable (a final String) will be appended to the display string
# UserSelectedField:     "com.lambda.Thing name"  ->   <Thing_23 John>
# SpecialFormatter:      com.lambda.Debugger.SpecialTimeStampFormatter
