DEVELOPER INFORMATION

Development is currently done in Eclipse.

BT747_PROJECT_COMMON_SRC is a linked resource pointing to the 'src' directory in the BT747 project.
To do that, in eclipse, do:
  Window -> Preferences, then,
  General -> Workspace -> Linked resources.
  There, create a linked resource 'BT747_PROJECT_COMMON_SRC' pointing to the src directory.
  
  
Symbol set.
  Contains local settings that are not shared.
  Should define agpsurlbase to point to base address of MTK EPO server.
  Create a Symbol Set called 'BT747' containing this definition.
  Example:
      agpsurlbase='ftp://login:pass@eposerver/'
      
  This serves to make the appropriate replacement in Version.java.
