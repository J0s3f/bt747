* Debug activation added in menu (and stats activation added, but not useable yet).

Version 1.03
* When no height was logged, problem in KML format (empty height) string resulting in bad
  display -> solved.
* Reason for 1.02: Proguard version problem -> false alert.  Actually a user problem.

Version 1.02
* Moved back to previous ProGuard version.  One user had a different behaviour on his handheld device.

Version 1.01
* Moved to ProGuard 4.0.1 (jar file optimization)
* Some optimizations in settings code.
* If not selecting ZDA, time for NMEA strings was incorrect.

Version 1.00
* Version 0.96.3 has been out for long enough.  I consider the application as stable enough to call it 1.00. 
* Added some extra error messages being propagated to the end user (file open/creation).

* A bug in the incremental download was introduced in 0.96.1.  The end of valid data was incorrectly identified.
  Corrected in this update.
  
Version 0.96.1
* Revisited log download algorithm.  Now requests can be queued.
  This was efficient over bluetooth where download was about 54k/second with the following settings on Palm:
    - Chunk size=220
    - Log ahead request=3
    - Timeout=3500
    - Fix = 500 ms
    - NMEA Output:
       RMC=1
       GGA=GSA=GSV=2

Version 0.95.14
* PPC/WinCE: Create 'My Documents/BT747' directory if it does not exist to save the application settings.

Version 0.95.13
* Application will no longer switch off automatically on Palm devices - this avoids some (timeout)
  trouble on Palm devices and avoid autooff during download.
* Path to log directory can now be set from pull-down list.
* Validated operation on Linux system (PCLinuxOS) and adjusted 'run_rxtx.sh' script.

Version 0.95.12

* NMEA format: speed written in knots was wrong conversion from speed in km/h
 (almost double instead of half).  Corrected.

Version 0.95.6
* Changed interface of connection tab.
* RxTx: different port name according to OS (Windows, Linux, Mac).  This allows direct
  use of RXTX on windows (and other systems) and should result in less installation
  hassle.
* Problems when interpreting satelite information solved:
 - data log specification problem;
 - last record of block;
 - false end of record identification.
* Moved BT747.jar and BT747_rxtx.jar to dist dir, this impact startup scripts.


Version 0.95.5
* Increased limits on fix setting (fix frequency slower than 1Hz now possible) and on 
  log reason settings (speed as low as 1km/h and distance as low as 1 m).

Version 0.95.4
* Added tickbox to remove difference between WGS84 and geoid (Mean Sea Level, MSL) from
  the logged height (as it was added by the logger).

  can read the log.
* Worked around a problem when satellite specific data is logged (sid, ele, snr, azimuth).
  The amount of data varies with the number of satelites - this is now covered for.
  The data is not interpreted though and not written to any output file (sorry, but I do
  not need that function and this is volunteering!).

  Now forcing the 'standard' parser on SuperWaba interface regardless of previous
  setting that could have been changed in the J2SE interface.
* The format bit that said 'Holux M-241' is actually indicating that only valid log points

* Some changes in startup order to see effect on WM5.0 device.

Version 1.42
* Improvements to binary log format interpretation, especially for Holux M-241 format.
  Has an impact on other log interpretations too (the implemented error recovery mechanism
  was hiding some bugs in the 'iBlue 747 like format interpretations).


Version 1.41

 is available.

Version 1.35
* Extra sanity check on a record to ensure that it is valid.
* Also writing WPT file when writing TRK file (CompeGPS).

Version 1.34
* Back to using the log format bit #31 to identify the log as a Holux specific log.
  The 'HOLUXGR241LOGGER' string is not necessarily in the log!

Version 1.33
* If binary file has '.trl' extension, it will be interpreted as a Holux tracklog file.
  Careful: the application can not generate such a file!

Version 1.32
* Added estimation of number of records to log Format Tab.

Version 1.31

  any statistics regarding bad sectors.
* Added initial delay to check if erase was successfull.

Version 1.23
* NSAT advanced filter logic was inverted - corrected

Version 1.22
* Solution provided in 1.21.2 resulted in KML format generation problems.
  Solution is improved.

Version 1.21.2

Version 1.21.1
* Added flash device type (no functional changes)

Version 1.21
* Advanced filter was not set up correctly - correctly.

  The program seems to behave normally on that OS now.

Version 1.19
* Added a popup when erasing that disappears when the erase is finished.
* Lag delay resolution on MacOS resolved - popups will flicker on MacOS though.
  This looks very much like a SuperWaba problem - maybe it will get analysed so

Version 1.16
* Added a timer to the applciation to see if this solves the MacOS GUI lag issue.

Version 1.15
* Reading GPS in 10ms intervals only - hopefully resolves 'speed' issue on MacOS.

Version 1.14
* Changed 'magvar' in 'course' for the 'heading' value in the 'gpx' format.

Version 1.13
* MacOSX startup script corrected (line endings, line split)
* Added possiblity to disable GPS NMEA String decoding (on Con tab).  Could have some
  impact on performance.
* Added possibility to write values to Flash (other tab) as some devices have a
  timesleft value other than 0.

Version 1.12
* Correction in advanced filter for NSAT filtering.
* Changes that should be 'invisible' to the user: calls to the superwaba environment pushed
  into a separate package for the 'core' of the program.  This prepares for J2ME implementation.
* Added functionality to be able to define the configuration file on the command line
  in 'RXTX' mode.

Version 1.11
* Added extra option to no longer separate in different tracks in GPX mode when new menu option is set.

Version 1.10
* Advanced filtering added (filtering on PDOP, VDOP, HDOP, speed, distance, record number.
  A new subtab in the filter tab added.  Advanced filtering must be set to 'active' in that
  tab to enable the filtering.

Version 1.09
* Correction to speed in GPX format (was always 0 after the change for 1.08.
* Incremental download: small improvement.

Version 1.08
* Fixed problem in incremental download (usefull data detection had an error => too much data redownloaded).
* GPX format: speed was in km/h and has to be in m/s -> solved.
* Incremental download: if data is different than before, user confirmation is requested.
  This way the user can still change the raw data filename (avoid overwriting previous data by mistake).
* NMEA format: more precision added (2 extra digits for position and one extra digit for speed).

Version 1.07
* Added path browsing capability to 'LogFile' entry on Filetab.  This allows easy opening of
  previously saved raw data file.
* Added functionality to separate files based on track time separation.

Version 1.06
* GPRMC NMEA string made similar to the one coming from device (extra field indicating autonomous or DGPS).
* Showing current Lat, Lon and Height in Connection window (if values are shown, reception is ok).

Version 1.05
* Added possiblity to force UTC offset in GPX format to 0 regardless of UTC setting.

Version 1.04
* Filter condition changed: now no longer selecting points when all conditions 'deselected'.
* Debug activation added in menu (and stats activation added, but not useable yet).

Version 1.03
* When no height was logged, problem in KML format (empty height) string resulting in bad
  display -> solved.
* Reason for 1.02: Proguard version problem -> false alert.  Actually a user problem.

Version 1.02
* Moved back to previous ProGuard version.  One user had a different behaviour on his handheld device.

Version 1.01
* Moved to ProGuard 4.0.1 (jar file optimization)
* Some optimizations in settings code.
* If not selecting ZDA, time for NMEA strings was incorrect.

Version 1.00
* Version 0.96.3 has been out for long enough.  I consider the application as stable enough to call it 1.00. 
* Added some extra error messages being propagated to the end user (file open/creation).
* It is now possible to select the NMEA strings to be written to the output file  (Other tab -> NMEA File tab).
* The device type (Model) is identified by its commercial name (or commercial equivalent).

Version 0.96.3
* A change for Macintosh: The mac does not need a port number, so port number omitted.
  Added possibility to override port name completely.

Version 0.96.2
* A bug in the incremental download was introduced in 0.96.1.  The end of valid data was incorrectly identified.
  Corrected in this update.
  
Version 0.96.1
* Revisited log download algorithm.  Now requests can be queued.
  This was efficient over bluetooth where download was about 54k/second with the following settings on Palm:
    - Chunk size=220
    - Log ahead request=3
    - Timeout=3500
    - Fix = 500 ms
    - NMEA Output:
       RMC=1
       GGA=GSA=GSV=2

Version 0.95.14
* PPC/WinCE: Create 'My Documents/BT747' directory if it does not exist to save the application settings.

Version 0.95.13
* Application will no longer switch off automatically on Palm devices - this avoids some (timeout)
  trouble on Palm devices and avoid autooff during download.
* Path to log directory can now be set from pull-down list.
* Validated operation on Linux system (PCLinuxOS) and adjusted 'run_rxtx.sh' script.

Version 0.95.12
* Google maps: when tracks are separated due to a trackpoint that is 'lost', track segments
  are interconnected with red line.


Version 0.95.11
* Added waypoints to Google Map output format and points are now 'encoded'.

Version 0.95.10
* Implemented 'GMAPS' output format : HTML file that will show trail on google maps.

Version 0.95.9
* Added functionality to read and change the NMEA string settings of the device.


Version 0.95.8
* PLT: conversion to height in feet was incorrect. Corrected.


Version 0.95.7
* NMEA format: speed written in knots was wrong conversion from speed in km/h
 (almost double instead of half).  Corrected.

Version 0.95.6
* Changed interface of connection tab.
* RxTx: different port name according to OS (Windows, Linux, Mac).  This allows direct
  use of RXTX on windows (and other systems) and should result in less installation
  hassle.
* Problems when interpreting satelite information solved:
 - data log specification problem;
 - last record of block;
 - false end of record identification.
* Moved BT747.jar and BT747_rxtx.jar to dist dir, this impact startup scripts.


Version 0.95.5
* Increased limits on fix setting (fix frequency slower than 1Hz now possible) and on 
  log reason settings (speed as low as 1km/h and distance as low as 1 m).

Version 0.95.4
* Added tickbox to remove difference between WGS84 and geoid (Mean Sea Level, MSL) from
  the logged height (as it was added by the logger).

Version 0.95.3
* KML format got improved: Track added (with extrusion) to show a line in stead of points.
* Some extra error messages in case of file problems.

Version 0.95.2
* Added specific target for Linux (serial port opening in entirely new class).
  A linux specific 'jar' file has been created (in the Linux directory).
  Experimental and untested.
* Bug fix: no more file was written when 'one file per day' was not selected.
* Performance improvement (profiled File output writing)
* KML format change (waypoints added).


Version 0.95.1
* Bug fix (on device): clone() method does not exist for arrays - replaced y explicit copy.
  User effect: java exception when converting to output format on device (solved).
* Bug fix: no more file was written when 'one file per day' was not selected.
* Performance improvement (profiled File output writing)

Version 0.95

* Satellite information written to CSV file.

Version 0.77.23
* Solved some bugs related to the file splitting per date & improved function to avoid files without elements.
* Added feature to change log format without erasing the device.  The resulting log can
  not be read by the original application delivered with the device, but this program
  can read the log.
* Worked around a problem when satellite specific data is logged (sid, ele, snr, azimuth).
  The amount of data varies with the number of satelites - this is now covered for.
  The data is not interpreted though and not written to any output file (sorry, but I do
  not need that function and this is volunteering!).

Version 0.77.22
* All formats now have a filename including the date.
* Method reuse in file output classes (resulting in smaller footprint)

Version 0.77.21
* Added popup message when file for download could not be opened.

* On ppc (wince), settings now saved on program exit.
* Log point filtering now separated for waypts and trkpts.
* Optimizing with proguard (resulting in smaller object files)

Version 0.77.18
* Updates to gpx format
* Setting saved on ppc (wince) OS.  Must click on 'set values button' in 'File' tab for the moment to save the settings.

Version 0.77.17
* Modified display of device version and application SW version for better information.
* Added NMEA output format (readable by locr SW).
* Added script and instructions for launching on Linux - partially validated.

Version 0.77.16

  directly in an excel graph.

Version 0.77.15

* Not really tested dev version!!!  Purpose deliver latest version on the web before 3 weeks leave.
* Should solve filtering bug when RCR or VALID field missing.
* Some (unnoticeable) bugs resolved.

Version 0.77.14

Version 0.77.12

* Handling more field.  Now all are handled except the variable fields concerning satelite
  information.
* Some (supposed) improvement on data download from device.  This is difficult to validate.

Version 0.77.11

* Added read of flash options (did not activate writing them since not possible it seems)

Version 0.77.10

* Added configuration option 'overwrite/stop'
* Added card selection functionality for Palm devices.
* Allow floating point entry for time interval.  Usefull for 5Hz logging (set time
  interval to 0.2s and fix to 200 ms).

Version 0.77.9

* Added connection version to connection page
* Correct logic concerning null pointer (hopefully this works!).
* Added repaint for all items that were potentially updated after reception of data.
* Added initial version to write Ozi PLT file.

Version 0.77.8
