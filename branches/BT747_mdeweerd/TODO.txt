A small text files with things that can be done for BT747.
There is no particular plan to implement this.  It is mainly a list so that nothing is forgotten.

PROBLEMS
* When there are a lot of pictures, loading the previews is too slow.
  - Need to improve worker task.
  - Could use preview data already available in pictures.

IMPROVEMENTS
(Things not very visible to the user).
* Detect power up/rest of device (Initial PMTK010) and use it to rerequest all the values.
* More precise height conversion (at least on PC).

FEATURES

Application
* Implement a sanity check of the parameters and warn the user if they seem strange:
  - Log conditions will not really log anything;
  - LAT/LON/TIME missing from format;
  - Too many NMEA strings for the serial speed.
* Automatically download data and upload to a server.
* Act as a server.
  - Show current position;
  - Allow remote app to get past data;
  - Provide map (html output, but through the server);
  - Allow configuration using browers (could also work on the local machine).
* Build a database of tracks:
  - Find past tracks easily based on time or on location;
  - Tag files without explicitly providing the files to use;
* More advanced track filtering.
* [Partially] rethink GUI.
  - Geotagging interface must be better;
  - Provide interface for dummies:

           [est. travel distance, travel time, precision
            and determine log conditions from that]
* Incremental download of 'overwrite' data by appending to existing file.
* Send SMS with current or past positions.

Device
* Add AGPS capability.
* Add SIRFIII support.
* Detect that a device has bad blocks.  Skip the blocks/propose to repair.
  [Does not seem to happen that often]

Tracks
* Allow changing data in J2SE gui.
* Allow saving data from the J2SE gui table(s).

Tagging
* Allow tagging using the exiftool.

Map
* Add scale to map.
* Use specific icons according to the waypoint type.
* Add google map - the legal way (integrate a browser).
