README file for the MTKBabel program

MTKBabel is a Perl program to operate the i-Blue 747 GPS data logger.
It should work also with other GPS devices based on the MediaTek MTK
chipset. It is free software released under the GPL license.

The main capabilities are:

  * Command line interface
  * Save data log in GPX and raw binary format
  * Change logging triggers: time, distance, speed
  * Change log format
  * START/STOP logging
  * Set OVERWRITE or STOP method on memory full
  * Erase the internal memory

The progam is written in Perl, and it was tested on Linux via USB
connection. One goal is easy portability to C and small RAM footprint.

Run mtkbabel -h for a brief help screen.

In order to run the mtkbabel program you should have installed a
standard Perl distribution, plus the following libraries:

  * Device::SerialPort
  * Date::Format

Check if your operating system provides a package for them, or refer
to the cpan(1) manual page.

You can install the packages using the following commands if you have a correct perl system:
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Device::SerialPort'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Format'


KNOWN BUGS

* Floating point numbers

Convesion of floating point numbers (64 bit doubles and 32 bit
floats) from MTK binary format to GPX text is done with the Perl
unpack() function.

This seems to work properly on the GNU/Linux i386 architecture,
(I think both uses IEEE 754 encoding). It fails - at least - on my
Arm box, with an XScale processor.

The functions mtk2double() mtk2float() should be rewritten using
some math library or in pure Perl.

* GPX 1.1 compliance

The generated GPX files are not fully xml compliant: some extra values
logged by the MTK chip are inserted as extra tags, not defined by the
GPX 1.1 standard.
